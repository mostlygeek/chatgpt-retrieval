### Individual Education Plan (IEP) for John Doe
Academic Year: 2021  
Teacher: **Mr. Steven Pots**

#### Summary from Teacher
During the 2021 academic year, John faced challenges adapting to remote learning. His existing issues with attention were exacerbated in a home setting, leading to difficulties in timely assignment completion. His reading abilities fell behind, and his social skills deteriorated, possibly due to fewer opportunities for face-to-face interactions. Despite these challenges, John demonstrated enthusiasm in subjects he finds interesting, notably mathematics.
