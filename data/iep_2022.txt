### Individual Education Plan (IEP) for John Doe
Academic Year: 2022  
Teacher: **Mr. David Miller**

#### Summary from Teacher
During the 2022 academic year, John struggled significantly with the transition to remote learning. His already-present difficulties in focusing became more pronounced in a home setting, and he struggled to complete assignments in a timely manner. His reading skills lagged, and social skills also declined, likely due to reduced face-to-face interactions. Despite facing these challenges, John showed a strong interest in subjects he finds captivating, particularly mathematics.
